The "Simple" Who is Who app for CCExtractor Development.

A lot of the code from the previous version of this app has been split up to make the app more modular.

Setting up the countdown timer and "packetization" (the ability for others to change the questions and answers by uploading to my [quiqui_imgs](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui_imgs) repo) was easily the two most difficult aspects of building the newer version of this app.
