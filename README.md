- [x] Packetization achieved! Check out [quiqui_imgs](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui_imgs) to see the psuedo-database for this app
- [x] Automatic deck generation! Check out [quiqui-support](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui-support) to see the service that scrapes images from the internet for the app

A lot of the code from the previous version of this app has been split up to make the app more modular.

Setting up the countdown timer and "packetization" (the ability for others to change the questions and answers by uploading to this repo: [quiqui_imgs](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui_imgs)) were easily the two most difficult aspects of building the newer version of this app.

The app uses [quiqui_imgs](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui_imgs) as a pseudo-database to store zipfiles of the images. The tool that uploads these packages to the repo is [quiqui-support](https://www.github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui-support).
